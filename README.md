# WebScraper Practice
 some practice creating a venv, as well as working with a 
 webscraper and other libraries<br /><br />

 The overall goal is to be able to scrape all the problems 
 that is on the site. Once that is successful, 
 the next step is to be able to learn how to randomize 
 what problems are being selected, take it out 
 from the list, and then repeat. <br /><br />

 Once above step is completed, I want to be able to visualize the 
 information pulled using Django. I want to be able to create a checklist
 of all the problems that were solved, as well as keep track of the notes
 that were written down for the problem. Future implementation will include
 containing old solution achieved, as well as optimized, or approach done in less time
 problem took to complete.
